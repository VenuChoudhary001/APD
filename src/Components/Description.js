              is one of the first outreach programs of the Debating society NIT
              Durgapur, and in our second edition, we're coming much bigger and
              better. This time we are expanding not only with regards to
              participants but also adjudicators from various parts of India.
              The prizes have been upped, as have been stakes. So come. Be a
              part of the action. Be a part of the magic. Battle it out and hold
              your own among the brightest minds and sharpest tongues on the
              debating circuit. The event is based upon the format of an Asian
              form of parliamentary debate, in which each team comprises three
              participants, and all the teams are given one of the two
              allocations, i.e. either the government or the opposition. The
              government consists of the Prime Minister, deputy prime minister,
              and the Whip whereas the opposition has The Leader of the
              Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the
              Opposition Whip. Then a government team and an opposition team are
              paired up against each other and given three topics out of which
              they had to rank in the order of preference, and then they are
              given one topic based on the ranking preference of each team. Once
              the topics is decided debaters have to speak in an order within
              due time. The Debating Society, NIT Durgapur, hence is proud to
              present before you APD II - the second edition of the Asian
              Parliamentary Debate.
